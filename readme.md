# Lime

Lime is written in C# and uses [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/).

My goal was to create a game engine that has similar structure to Unity and only supports 2D games with simple physics.

### <b>Lime Components</b>

* Lime - Namespace for basic components
* Animation - Namespace for animating sprites
* Input - Namespace for handling input from keyboard and controllers. This does not handle input from mouse
* PseudoPhysics - Namespace that does simple physics calculations like checking if objects are colliding. This no handle things like collision and gravity. (These things might be implemented later if a need arrises)
